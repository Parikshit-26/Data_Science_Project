## üìà Visualizations & Methodology

The analysis was performed using **Python** and deployed via **Google Colab**.

The methodology included:

| Plot Type | Purpose | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Line & Bar Plot** | Time-series trend of Revenue, Expenditure, and annual Surplus/Deficit. | Revenue shows a general upward trend, but the budget was in deficit in 3 of the 6 years. |
| **Scatter Plot** | Relationship between Revenue and Expenditure. | Confirmed a strong positive correlation, with years above the break-even line (Expenditure \> Revenue) representing deficits. |
| **Box Plot** | Distribution of the Surplus/Deficit values. | Showed the wide range of financial results, emphasizing the high risk/volatility. |
